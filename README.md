<h1>Matplotlib Challenge</h1>

For this assignment, we were given data from a study testing the effectiveness of a new drug called Campomulin versus other treatments.  In this study, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens, including Campomuin. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.

Our goal for this assignment is to produce the following:
1.  Generage summary statistics table consisting of the mean, medial, variance and standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volum for each drug regimen.
2.  Plot the number of data points for each regimen.
3.  Calculate the final tumor volum of each mouse across four of the most promising treatement regimens:  Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin  

<h2>Insights</h2>
1.  Tumor response to treatment

Camplmulin is the most effect drug in reducing tumor volume and works best over time.<br><p></p>

<p>2.  Survival during treatment</p>

Campomulin has the highest survival rate.<p></p>

<p>3.  Tumor change</p>

Campomulin reduced tumor volume on average about 20% while other drugs had similar performance as the placebo.
